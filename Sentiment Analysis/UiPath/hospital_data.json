They have a excellent team in labour room, surgical ICU. The securiry, ward, billing, insurance are doing experiment to making others job put in tose.No proper communication, miss behaviour of ward nurse. No quality aminities, no cleanness,  even u pay 2lcs or more. Its better to go any govt hospital. ",

I had booked myself for Covid Vaccination THROUGH MANIPAL HOSPITAL APP for 10:05 today. had assumed that having booked a particular time, the hospital will uphold the commitment of time and do the necessary with a mild delay(if any). I had also paid online for the same thus making the work easier for the hospital. Had reached at 10:00 to see complete confusion here and no one to guide on the process. Post running around, got the form filled and was asked to wait(at 10:10). it is 11:30 now and I am still waiting to be called. This seems to be the height of unprofessionalism, am surprised that such an institution is acting this way. Moreover, had to receive some rude answers \"if you can wait good, else come some other day\" by the lady managing the setup. Approached the admin head resulting in just nice useless words and further waiting. The issue is there is no value given for people\u2019s time and feelings. The last 90 minutes, have seen many senior citizens getting agitated by the treatment given by the staff. To make matters worse, a gentleman and his wife who knew a doctor here, walked in and walked out within 10 min. I have been associated with Manipal hospitals for over 20 years now and am regretting the association. The hospital staff should learn how to manage people / processes and most importantly abstain from being rude. Overall a shameful experience. ",

If you want live long don't choose this hospital. On May  me and my husband visited hospital for my husband had tumor in his bile. One of my nearest Dr. Suggested this hospital. Due to Covid situation I can't take him to my native. So we started treating in Manipal by believing the Doctors and the Hospital. He got Jaundice also in that time. So treatment was essential. What ever the Doctor said I just followed that. One day just to fix the stent he admitted in hospital. After that fixed Surgery on August 10. 2020. My husband was fully active in that time he was driving the vehicle. After  surgery (Whipple procedure). He became very tired and day by day got wait lost. He was not fully recovery yet also Doctor told to discharge. After went home with in ten days again got admitted bcz of more leakage from surgery area. Even he can't eat food 4 months used to give through the stomach tube that also only liquid.  We was in hospital for 14 days. After one month again he admitted doctor told will start TPN. To improve his body wait only 2 days admission is required. I want to see him healthy so he got admitted. Once the TPN started he was getting lot of side effects. And also the was giving insulin for daibatic. Bcz of these two he turned to brain strock. After two days he was not able to talk and moove.  We was in hospital for 8 days doctors told he is not responding for medicine. Now my husband is  no more at the age of 47. Very wurst Doctors and some nurses. I don't want reveal the doctors (nurses) name.But I will tell one thing that devils killed my husband. ",
